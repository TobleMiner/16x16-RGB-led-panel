16x16 LED matrix board
======================

This board is a carrier for small 1x1mm RGB LEDs. It connects pin 1 of
each LED column and the remaining pins of each row together, exposing them
via BGA-style contact pads at the bottom side of the PCB.  
The board has been designed for use with
[this](https://github.com/TobleMiner/RGB-led-nametag) project. However it
is fairly generic and could most certainly be used in your own projects,
too.
